# Implementation Plan: Language Project Archiving and Detail-View Routing

**Branch**: `012-language-archive-routing` | **Date**: 2026-07-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-language-archive-routing/spec.md`

## Summary

Give admins a way to soft-delete ("archive") a language project — retaining all
translation data — but block archiving whenever another **active** language still
uses it as its source (`defaultSrcLang`), naming the dependents so the admin can
re-point them first. Independently, give the admin language **detail view** a real
routable URL (`/languages/:languageId`) so refresh, back/forward, and shared links
work.

Technical approach: add a single `archived boolean NOT NULL` column to
`languages` (default `false`); filter archived rows uniformly in both
`Persistence.languages()` and `Persistence.language()` so archived languages
vanish from every web picker, translating into them is rejected for free
(`TranslateHome` → `CodeError`), and mid-session tString saves are rejected for
free (`invalidCode` → 401); add a new `Persistence.archiveLanguage(languageId)`
method that locks the language row and runs the dependency check + flag-set in
one transaction, exposed via a new admin-only endpoint
`POST /api/admin/languages/:languageId/archive`; symmetrically validate
`defaultSrcLang` re-points against active languages (closes the archive/re-point
race and the dangling-reference hole — research D4); and drive `LanguagesBox`'s
selection from a new `/languages/:languageId` route (rendering `AdminHome`),
gating the archived/bogus redirect (a `replace` navigation) on the
load-completion flag. A reusable confirmation dialog is added to
`base-components`.

## Brainstorm Context

**Source**: [specs/brainstorms/2026-07-22-language-project-deletion-and-url-management-requirements.md](../brainstorms/2026-07-22-language-project-deletion-and-url-management-requirements.md)

### Key Decisions Carried Forward

- **Soft delete (archive), not hard delete**: translation work (tStrings,
  progress, documents) is preserved in the DB; archived rows are hidden from active
  use. → constrains the storage model (D1) and read-path filtering (D2).
- **One-way from the UI (no restore)**: no un-archive endpoint/UI; the generic
  update endpoint's field allow-list prevents clearing `archived` (D3, INV-3).
- **Dependency block (not warning-and-allow)**: a dangling `defaultSrcLang` is a
  worse failure than a blocked action → server enforces the block atomically (D4/D5).
- **Route shape `/languages/:languageId`** matching the flat `/lessons/:id`
  pattern, not nested under `/admin/*` (D7).
- **Any language can be a source** (not just English); English gets no
  special-casing — it is blocked naturally whenever active languages depend on it.

### Scope Boundaries (explicit non-goals)

- No restore/un-archive UI.
- No route/state change for the Languages **list** page — only the **detail** view
  gains a route.
- No bulk archive.
- No new re-pointing UX — dependents are re-pointed via the existing per-language
  source-language picker; this feature only blocks and surfaces the dependent list.
- **Desktop sync propagation of archival is a non-goal** (research D9).

### Deferred Questions (resolved during planning)

- Storage representation of "archived" → boolean column, NOT NULL default false (D1).
- Where the dependency check lives → server-side, inside a transaction holding a
  lock on the target language row, mirrored by active-target validation on the
  `defaultSrcLang` re-point path; client pre-flight is UX-only (D4/D5).
- Confirmation UX → reusable yes/no confirm dialog in base-components, per
  DESIGN.md; typed-name confirmation not required (D10).
- List folded/selected state sync with the route → `LanguagesBox` reads the route
  param and auto-unfolds; redirect gated on load-completion (D6/D7).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (ES2022, CommonJS, strict + all strict flags), Node 24 (nvm)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 16 + Redux Toolkit, `react-router-dom` v6, Express, `postgres@1` (domain driver via `Persistence`)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL `languages` table (domain data → through `Persistence`, Principle VI); new `archived boolean` column via a `migrations/` file
**Testing**: Jest (unit/integration, TDD), Cypress (web E2E) — Principle I
**Target Platform**: Web (Express + React); admin-only surface. Desktop/Electron unaffected (non-goal D9)
**Project Type**: Web application — isomorphic four-layer (`core`/`server`/`frontend`/`desktop`)
**Performance Goals**: Interactive admin action; archive completes < 30s start-to-finish without engineering help (SC-001)
**Constraints**: Server is source of truth for the dependency check — check + archive MUST be atomic via a transaction locking the target language row, with the `defaultSrcLang` re-point path validating against active languages under the same lock discipline (spec line 116, D4). Archived rows invisible to every web picker (INV-1). Strict type safety, zero ESLint warnings, 95% jest coverage gate
**Scale/Scope**: Small admin dataset (tens of languages). Changes span `core` model, `server` controller/storage + migration, `frontend` router/box/base-component

## Presentation Design

**Component Framework**: React 16 + the repo's `src/frontend/common/base-components/` kit (`Button`, `Div`, `Heading`, `Foldable`, `List`, `LinkButtonRow`), styled per `DESIGN.md` (flat / no-shadow elevation, `Colors.ts` palette, Helvetica scale)
**Interaction Patterns**: Redux Toolkit state (`languageSlice`), `react-router-dom` v6 navigation (`useParams` / `useNavigate`), `useLoad`/`usePush` request hooks
**Accessibility Target**: WCAG 2.2 AA — dialog is keyboard-operable (focusable confirm/cancel, Esc to cancel), archive action reachable by keyboard, dependent-list message is readable text (not color-only)

### UI Decisions

| Screen / Component                   | User Story | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Design Skills                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confirmation dialog (base-component) | US1        | New reusable `ConfirmDialog` in `base-components`, flat modal per DESIGN.md; states the action cannot be undone from within the product                                                                                                                                        | `/design-language-to-daisyui` n/a → `/design-clarify` (microcopy: warning + undone message) |
| Archive action + blocked message     | US2        | `Archive` button in `LanguageView`; blocked path renders an inline message listing dependent language names (from the blocked branch of the `ArchiveLanguageResult` **200** union — see Adversarial Hardening RT-A), announced via an `aria-live`/`role="alert"` region (RT-C) | `/design-clarify` (blocked-reason copy), `/design-onboard` n/a                              |
| Language detail view (routed)        | US3        | `LanguagesBox` selection driven by `/languages/:languageId`; renders existing `LanguageView`; loading snake before redirect on cold load                                                                                                                                       | `/design-adapt` (works on refresh/direct load)                                              |

### Quality Pass

**Design quality target**: Production
**Post-implementation refinement**: `/design-clarify` (confirm + blocked-dependents copy), `/design-audit` (dialog focus/keyboard/contrast against DESIGN.md)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

| Principle                                  | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Status |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| I. Test-First (TDD; E2E for user flows)    | All new logic (model guard, storage filter, dependency check, archive endpoint, route/box selection, confirm dialog) is unit-testable and will be written test-first; the three user flows get Cypress E2E + acceptance specs. Meets the mandate.                                                                                                           | PASS   |
| II. Type Safety & Static Analysis          | `archived: boolean` is a required, concrete field (D8); new `ArchiveLanguageResult`/blocked-response types are explicit; no `any`. Strict-boolean-safe (`WHERE NOT archived`, `!l.archived`). Ripple across `Language` literals resolved to keep types honest.                                                                                              | PASS   |
| III. Code Quality (JSDoc, naming, imports) | New public functions/components (archive helper, `ConfirmDialog`) carry JSDoc; PascalCase types; import order preserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PASS   |
| IV. Pre-commit Quality Gates               | `yarn typecheck` + lint-staged + related jest must pass; conventional commit via `/commit`. No `--no-verify`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PASS   |
| V. Warning/Deprecation Policy              | The `archived`-field ripple will surface typecheck errors across fixtures/tests; these are fixed in-phase, not deferred (D8).                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PASS   |
| VI. Layered Architecture & Persistence     | `archived` is **domain** data → all access routes through `Persistence` (`languages()`, `language()`, new `archiveLanguage()`). Transactions are a storage concern, so the atomic check-and-set lives behind the interface (D3/D4). No new server-only exemption invoked. `core` stays isomorphic (model-only change). Desktop path untouched (D9).         | PASS   |
| VII. Simplicity & Maintainability          | One boolean column; one new `Persistence` method (`archiveLanguage`) — required because `updateLanguage` can neither join a transaction nor return an archived row under the D2 filter (D3); reuse `AdminHome` for the routed detail view (D7); uniform filter gives FR-004 **and** the mid-session-save rejection for free (D2). No speculative machinery. | PASS   |

**Result**: PASS — no violations; Complexity Tracking left empty.

**Post-Phase-1 re-check**: Design artifacts (data-model, contracts, quickstart)
introduce no new interfaces beyond one endpoint and one route, one model field,
and one base-component. No principle regresses. Gate remains **PASS**.

**Structure Decision**: Web application on the existing isomorphic four-layer
architecture. Domain change (`archived`) lives in `core/models` and flows through
`Persistence`; the archive gate lives in `server/controllers` + `server/storage`;
routing/UI in `frontend/web` + a reusable `frontend/common/base-components` dialog.
Desktop is deliberately untouched (D9).

## Acceptance Test Strategy

> **ATDD Outer Loop**: Each user story with acceptance scenarios gets a spec file
> created during `sp:05-tasks`, in `specs/acceptance-specs/` (GWT format).

| User Story                                              | Acceptance Spec File                                              | Scenarios |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| US1: Archive a language project that's no longer needed | `specs/acceptance-specs/US01-archive-language.txt`                | 3         |
| US2: Prevent archiving a language others depend on      | `specs/acceptance-specs/US02-prevent-archive-with-dependents.txt` | 3         |
| US3: Language detail view has a real, shareable URL     | `specs/acceptance-specs/US03-language-detail-url.txt`             | 4         |

**Pipeline**: `specs/acceptance-specs/*.txt` → `acceptance/parse-specs.ts` →
`acceptance/generate-tests.ts` → `generated-acceptance-tests/*.spec.ts`

## Adversarial Hardening (Red Team)

Findings from the `/sp:04-red-team` review, with the mitigation folded into the
design. Cross-artifact findings are propagated into `contracts/*` and
`data-model.md` (noted per finding) so `/sp:05-tasks` generates congruent tasks.
Pass 1 = RT-A…RT-E; Pass 2 = RT-F…RT-G (second-order effects of Pass 1's
mitigations).

### RT-A (High, Congruence) — Blocked-dependents result must be a 200 body, not a 409

**Concern**: The contract specified the blocked case as an HTTP **409 with a JSON
body** `{ error: "HAS_DEPENDENTS", dependents: [...] }`, but the repo's request
convention cannot deliver it. `addPostHandler` → `handleErrors`
(`src/server/api/WebAPI.ts:33-43`) sends `res.status(status).send()` — an **empty
body** — for _any_ thrown status. So a thrown 409 arrives at the client with **no
dependents list**, and FR-008 / US2 (name the dependents so the admin can
re-point) becomes unsatisfiable. The contract was also internally inconsistent:
its `Api.ts` typing already declares the response as `ArchiveLanguageResult` (the
ok ∪ blocked union — a 200 body), contradicting its own "409-with-body" prose.

**Mitigation**: Deliver both outcomes as a **200 discriminated union**
`ArchiveLanguageResult`:

- ok: `{ archived: true; languageId: number }`
- blocked: `{ error: "HAS_DEPENDENTS"; dependents: { languageId: number; name: string }[] }`

The endpoint returns this via the normal `res.json(result)` path (no throw). Only
the bodiless statuses stay as thrown errors: **404** (target not an active
language) and **401/403** (non-admin). Rationale for 200-union over a bespoke
409-with-body handler, both codebase-specific:

- `PostRoutes` types only the **success** body, so a 409 body would be **untyped**
  — a Principle II (type-safety) regression.
- A 409-with-body requires a bespoke handler bypassing `addPostHandler` — a
  Principle VII (simplicity) regression.

**Propagation**: `contracts/archive-language.md` Responses section (collapse the
409-body into the 200 union; keep 404/401/403 as bodiless throws); the frontend
`languageSlice` thunk/pusher **discriminates the union** (`"error" in result`)
rather than catching a 409; UI Decisions table updated above.

### RT-B (High, Completeness) — Atomic `defaultSrcLang` re-point needs a dedicated storage method

**Concern**: D4 mandates the re-point path validate the new `defaultSrcLang` is
active **inside a transaction that locks the target source-language row**. The
plan routed this through the generic update endpoint calling
`storage.updateLanguage`. But research D3 already establishes that
`updateLanguage` (`PGStorage.ts:64-69`) always runs on `this.sql` with **no
transaction parameter** — the exact reason `archiveLanguage` was split out as its
own method. So the re-point validation is, by the plan's own reasoning, **not
atomically implementable through `updateLanguage`**: it degrades to a
check-then-update TOCTOU that reopens the very archive/re-point race D4 exists to
close.

**Mitigation**: Add a dedicated transactional `Persistence` method (signature
finalized by RT-F below), mirroring `archiveLanguage`: one `this.sql.begin(...)`
that locks the target row, validates a new `defaultSrcLang` is active, applies the
update, and commits. The generic update endpoint routes through this method
instead of `updateLanguage`. `testStorage` mirrors the semantics synchronously.

> **Superseded by RT-F (Pass 2)**: the original name/signature here
> (`repointDefaultSrcLang(languageId, srcLangId)`, `defaultSrcLang`-only) was
> revised — see RT-F for the authoritative
> `updateLanguageChecked(languageId, {motherTongue?, defaultSrcLang?}) => Language`.

**Propagation**: `Persistence.ts` + `languagesController.ts` + `PGStorage.ts` +
`testStorage.ts` touchpoints updated above; `contracts/archive-language.md`
"Companion change" section; `data-model.md` "Write path (re-point)" + INV-4.

### RT-C (Medium, Accessibility) — ConfirmDialog + blocked message need full modal a11y

**Concern**: The plan targets WCAG 2.2 AA and introduces a **from-scratch** modal
(`ConfirmDialog`), but specifies only "focusable confirm/cancel, Esc to cancel."
That omits the load-bearing modal semantics: (a) **focus trap** — Tab/Shift+Tab
must cycle within the dialog while open; (b) **initial focus** moved into the
dialog on open; (c) **focus return** to the triggering Archive button on close
(both confirm and cancel); (d) ARIA dialog semantics — `role="dialog"`,
`aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` pointing at the dialog heading. Separately,
the **blocked-dependents message** renders asynchronously after a failed archive;
without an `aria-live="assertive"` / `role="alert"` region, screen-reader users
never perceive it (WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages).

**Mitigation**: Add the above to `ConfirmDialog` and the blocked-message region.
These are UI-internal (no interface/data-shape impact) → **plan.md only**;
`/design-audit` in the Quality Pass verifies focus/keyboard/contrast.

### RT-D (Medium, EdgeCase/Congruence) — Archived-language document fetch now 404s

**Concern**: Making `language()` filter archived rows changes
`GET /api/languages/:languageId/lessons/:lessonId/document`
(`documentsController.ts:16-31`): `storage.language()` returns `null` for an
archived language, so its existing `if (!lesson || !language) throw { status:404 }`
now 404s for a language's retained documents. This is **safe** (no crash — it
already null-checks) but is an unenumerated behavior change for data FR-002 says
is "retained." The plan enumerated the translate and tString consumer paths (D2)
but not this document-fetch path.

**Mitigation**: This is the intended consequence (archived ⇒ hidden from active
use, consistent with INV-1) — document it and add a regression test asserting the
archived-language document fetch 404s. Plan-only; no interface/data change.

### RT-E (Low, ErrorHandling) — Transaction abort / deadlock surfaces as a bare 500

**Concern**: Two concurrent re-points forming a lock cycle (admin A re-points L1
onto X while admin B re-points X onto L1) can trip a Postgres deadlock (40P01);
Postgres aborts one transaction. Under `handleErrors` this surfaces as an
unhandled `err` → bare **500** with the DB error logged. Rare and admin-only, but
worth a defined behavior.

**Mitigation**: Acceptable to leave as a 500 for this admin-only, rare path;
optionally map serialization/deadlock failures (`err.code === "40P01" ||
"40001"`) to a 409/503 "please retry." Plan-only note; no design-artifact change.

### RT-F (High, Completeness/Congruence — Pass 2) — The re-point method must persist `motherTongue` too and return the `Language`

**Concern** (second-order effect of RT-B): RT-B split the generic update endpoint
so a `defaultSrcLang` change goes through the new transactional method while
"the `motherTongue`-only update path still uses `updateLanguage`." But the actual
client never sends a single-field update. `pushLanguageUpdate`
(`languageSlice.ts:116-125`) **always** posts
`{ motherTongue: language.motherTongue, defaultSrcLang: language.defaultSrcLang }`
— both fields, every time — and both `LanguageView` handlers spread the full
`activeLang` before posting (`LanguageView.tsx:39-47`,
`handleSrcLangChange`/`handleMTChange`). So there is **no `motherTongue`-only
request** to route to `updateLanguage`; RT-B's dichotomy is unimplementable as
written. A server branch of the form "if body has `defaultSrcLang` →
`repointDefaultSrcLang` (which only writes `defaultSrcLang`)" would **silently
drop every mother-tongue toggle**. Two further gaps in the RT-B method as
specified: (a) its return shape was never defined, yet the endpoint is typed
`Language` (`Api.ts:86-90`) and the client dispatches `addLanguage(updated)` with
it (`languageSlice.ts:123`) — returning less breaks the type and staled Redux
state; (b) re-validating `defaultSrcLang` on **every** call would make an
MT-only toggle 422 whenever a pre-feature row already carried a
dangling/legacy `defaultSrcLang` (INV-4 was never enforced on historical data).

**Mitigation**: Replace RT-B's `repointDefaultSrcLang(languageId, srcLangId)` with
a single transactional method that persists the **whole** filtered update and
returns the row:

```
updateLanguageChecked(languageId: number, update: { motherTongue?: boolean; defaultSrcLang?: number }) => Promise<Language>
```

One `this.sql.begin(...)`: lock the target language row `FOR UPDATE`; **only when
`update.defaultSrcLang` is present AND differs from the row's current value**,
validate the new target is active (`SELECT ... WHERE languageId = :defaultSrcLang
AND NOT archived FOR UPDATE`) and reject (422) if missing/archived — skipping the
check on an unchanged value avoids 422-ing MT toggles over legacy dangling
pointers; `UPDATE languages SET ...` both provided fields; re-read and **return
the `Language`**. Re-reading here is safe (and required) — unlike
`archiveLanguage`, the updated row stays **active**, so `language({languageId})`
returns it and does not hit the D2 archived filter (RT-A's "must not re-read" rule
applies only to the archive path). The endpoint response type stays `Language`
(`Api.ts:86-90` unchanged). The name `updateLanguageChecked` (not
`repointDefaultSrcLang`) reflects that it writes both fields — keeps Principle III
/ `/glossary` honest.

**Propagation**: reconciled the now-false "`motherTongue`-only path uses
`updateLanguage`" prose in `plan.md` (RT-B mitigation), `contracts/archive-language.md`
(Companion change), and `data-model.md` (Write path re-point); source-structure
touchpoints above updated to `updateLanguageChecked`; `Api.ts` response stays
`Language` (no change — stated for congruence).

### RT-G (Medium, ErrorHandling — Pass 2) — Rejected re-point (bodiless 422) leaves optimistic UI diverged with no feedback

**Concern** (second-order effect of RT-B/RT-F): when `updateLanguageChecked`
rejects a re-point onto a just-archived/nonexistent source, it throws **422**,
which — by the same `handleErrors` mechanism RT-A identified
(`WebAPI.ts:33-43`, `res.status(status).send()`) — reaches the client as an
**empty body**: the client cannot render a server-provided reason. Meanwhile
`handleSrcLangChange` (`LanguageView.tsx:39-41`) sets `activeLang.defaultSrcLang`
to the new value **optimistically before** the awaited push and never reverts on
failure. Result: the `SelectInput` keeps showing the rejected source while the
server stored the old one — silent divergence, no user feedback.

**Mitigation** (plan.md only — UI-internal, no interface/data-shape change): on
push failure, (a) **revert** the optimistic `setActiveLang` to the prior
`defaultSrcLang`, and (b) surface a **generic** client-side message (e.g. "That
source language is no longer available — it may have been archived; pick another")
via the same `aria-live`/`role="alert"` region added for RT-C. The message must
be client-authored: the 422 is bodiless, so no server reason can arrive — do not
spec a server-provided string. `/design-clarify` covers the copy.
